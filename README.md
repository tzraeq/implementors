# implementors
The Implementors plugins add the possibility to jump to the implementation of of an interface. Alternatively, you can jump to the interface of an implementation.

The jumping to implementation/interface works for plain Java files. In addition, when associating EJB deployment descriptors with a project, the plugin is made aware of the connection between the EJB interfaces and the implementation class, something which is not specified in the implementation class itself.
